    statement: `Flibber jabber wibble waddle, the quixotic quokka danced on a moonbeam, juggling jellybeans and whispering secrets to the kaleidoscope sky. Zorbing through zesty zinfandel, the platypus pirouetted atop a lavender pancake, serenading sunflowers with a kazoo. Blinking stardust, the luminous llama leapfrogged over technicolor tulips, while giggling goblins gallivanted in gumdrop gardens. Whimsical whispers wafted on the breeze as marmalade marshmallows marshalled melodic marsh hens. In this topsy-turvy tapestry of ticklish twilight, a zephyr of zany zigzags wove wonderment and whimsy, crafting a cacophony of fantastical frivolity. Thus, the world twinkled with twirling teapots and tapestry dreams, delighting in delightful delirium.`,
